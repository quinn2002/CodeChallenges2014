CodeChallenges2014
==================

Initial commit of the STG Weekly Code Challenges from summer 2014.  Currently, these are all Windows console applications.

At this point, each of the 14 weekly code challenges are in their own self-contained project.  Simply open the sln file, set the start-up project to the desired application, run, and follow the command-line prompts.

Enjoy!
