CodeChallenges2014
==================

Project contains all of the STG Weekly Code Challenges from summer 2014.  Currently, these are all Windows console applications, as well as an MVC web app that brings all of the challenges together in a common end-user interface.

At this point, each of the 14 weekly code challenges are in their own self-contained project.  Simply open the sln file, set the start-up project to the desired application, and run!  I've included the necessary seed data for the MVC app.

Enjoy!
