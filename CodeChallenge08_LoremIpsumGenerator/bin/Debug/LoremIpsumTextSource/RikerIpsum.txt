Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Ensign Babyface! We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Damage report! About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. Well, that's certainly good to know. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Sorry, Data. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I am your worst nightmare! Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Not if I weaken first. Computer, lights up! I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. This should be interesting. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? We have a saboteur aboard. I guess it's better to be lucky than good.
